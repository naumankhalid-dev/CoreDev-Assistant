[2025-11-24 19:32:37] Bot: **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Example**
=====================================================

In this example, we will create a simple banking system using OOP principles in Python.

**Classes and Objects**
------------------------

A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behavior of an object. An object is an instance of a class and has its own set of attributes (data) and methods (functions).

### Bank Class

```python
class Bank:
    def __init__(self, name, address):
        """
        Initialize the bank with name and address.

        Args:
            name (str): Name of the bank.
            address (str): Address of the bank.
        """
        self.name = name
        self.address = address
        self.accounts = {}

    def create_account(self, account_number, balance):
        """
        Create a new account with the given account number and balance.

        Args:
            account_number (str): Unique account number.
            balance (float): Initial balance
